# All Code
## General Guidelines

The following guidelines apply to all code.

* Write your code in whichever editor you prefer
* Use two spaces for indentation
* Delete your [trailing whitespace][space]
* Each file should have an empty line at the end
* Leave comments when necessary that follow the comment style of the particular language
* When naming things such as variables or classes, be descriptive. Using abbreviations, for example, may not be easy to understand for other developers.

Need help? A lot of these things can be controlled within the settings of the particular editor you are using. There also extensions such as [Prettier][prettier] that can automatically format your code for you.
