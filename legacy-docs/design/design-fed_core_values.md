# Frontend Designer Core Values

## Collaboration
We believe in gathering feedback throughout the life of our projects. Involving website users, other frontend designers, client stakeholders, and current project team members early allows us to get a wide range of feedback that makes our work better.

## Empathy
We believe in putting ourselves in others’ shoes. We strive to understand the users of the products we build. We strive to build accessible products that serve a diverse range of people. We are responsible with our clients’ budgets and aware of the value we are giving them. We look to make our team’s jobs easier by understanding each others’ roles.

## Design Expertise
We’re passionate about what design can do for our clients' businesses and the users we build for. We make informed design decisions that align with project goals. We craft the details. We constantly refine. We strive for clarity.

## Growth
We get better at what we do by staying up to date and pushing ourselves to innovate and try new tools and processes. We believe innovation in design takes exploration. We’re okay with sometimes leaving concepts on the cutting room floor. We look for opportunities outside of client projects to stretch our skills.

## Flexibility
We try to do what’s right for the clients we work with, and that may look different from project to project. We can use tools that mesh with our client’s team. We can bring in client teams to our process. We determine design deliverables based on what we feel is right for each project and client. We realize the ideal way to do things isn’t always appropriate. We iterate and continually improve as we get new information or new constraints.
