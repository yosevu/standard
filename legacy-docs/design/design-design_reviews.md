# Design Reviews

## Overview

These guidelines put a structure around how we review design concepts internally and glean valuable feedback. If possible, the design concept should be posted in advance for participants to review and process before the meeting. 

## Things to Remember

1. Everyone’s opinions are equal
2. Everyone participates
3. The goal of feedback is to make the project better and should not be taken personally
4. Stay in the same mindset as a group (analytical vs. creative)
    1. Answer analytical questions
    2. Solve problems

## What is Needed

- Print outs of concepts hung on the wall
- Comps in InVision for sharing and commenting
- Facilitator (most likely J in most cases)
- Note-taker (specific comments made in InVision)
- Designer
- Other project or design team members


## Design Review Meeting Structure
**Questions (Analytical – first 45 min)**

1. The designer explains the documented project goals.
2. The designer gives an overview of the design reasoning, talking about their approach and calling out what elements of the design are related to the objectives and project goals.
3. Participants discuss whether those elements effectively achieve the objective.
4. Why or why not?
5. What do we want the user to do? Discuss CTAs, actions, etc.

**Problem Solving (Creative – second 45 min)**

1. Evaluate any other elements that may not support the project goal.
    1. Is there a clear visual hierarchy?
    2. Are the fonts, shapes, color, buttons, etc. visually consistent?
    3. How does the design scale to different screen sizes?
    4. How does the design scale modularly to accommodate different types of content?
    5. Is there adequate color contrast for critical text? Does it accommodate other accessibility concerns?
    6. Is the design concept within scope to build?
    7. Are there other assets needed to complete the design, such as photography, copywriting, etc.?
2. Generate ideas to solve problems identified in previous steps.

## After the Review
Following the review, the designer reviews the notes and makes a list of action items to address if clear actions haven’t been established.
