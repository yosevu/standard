# Kickoff Meetings 
## Philosophy
Whenever possible we like to do some groundwork to hear what a project should cover from internal stakeholders, our team, and potential users prior to having a kickoff meeting. This may also include some additional background work to better understand the project landscape depending on the project. Below is a sample agenda. Some of the exercises can be found at http://goodkickoffmeetings.com. Kevin M. Hoffman also has some great philosphy/context in tis article: http://alistapart.com/article/kick-ass-kickoff-meetings.

## Sample Agenda
Over the next day and a half together we hope to get a better understanding around:
