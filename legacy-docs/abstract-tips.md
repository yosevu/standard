# Abstract Checklist: Tips for Writing a Good Session Abstract
*Thoughts borrowed and condensed from Jim Holmes (frazzleddad.blogspot.com)*

+ **Communicate the value.** Does it explain the value of what folks will get from your session?
+ **Focus.** Is it overly broad? If so, focus on specifics. 
+ **Titles matter.** Make sure it’s catchy and showcases what your session is about.
+ **Explain what attendees will get out of the session.** Make it clear what your attendees will learn during your session. “You’ll leave this session with a handle on ways to smooth out your project’s environment” or “This session will show you a great system for boosting customer collaboration and increasing your code’s quality” are good examples.
+ **Examples.** Include examples of what will be discussed.
+ **Format.** Introduction, body, conclusion. Hook in the opening. 
+ **Include feedback.** Have you presented this topic before and received positive, meaningful feedback? If so, include.
+ **Keep it concise.** One to two paragraphs should be enough. 
+ **Do you need a bio?** If you need to include a bio, make sure it’s not longer than your abstract.
