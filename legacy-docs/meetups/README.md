# Meetups

How to run a meetup at Sparkbox.

## Website/Calendar

- Parking - Someone needs to speak with the autobody shop next door to find out if they are ok with people parking there, and we should let them know the schedule.
- Know/distribute Topic at least 3 weeks in advance (to have it before prior meetup would be ideal, so we can also announce at that)
- Include the topics list
- Backup topic
