* Callout attributes that are required
  * `data` `href` `alt` `title` `style` `role`

## Semantic HTML
... differentiate between valid HTML and semantic HTML, explaining the difference between semantic and non-semantic elements (for example, `<article>` vs. `<div>`), and an example of inappropriate use of semantic elements (for example, using an `<h2>` followed by an `<h4>`.

## Validate HTML
... demonstrate use of W3C Markup Validation Service to confirm the validity of markup for a webpage.

## Page structure

## The Cascade
... differentiate between css properties that trickle down from parent to child selectors (`color`, `font-size`), and properties that donâ€™t necessarily move down the cascade (`margin`, `padding`). They can also give an example of a CSS conflict and how it relates to the cascade.
