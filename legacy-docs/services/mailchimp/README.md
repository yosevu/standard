# Mailchimp

![Image of Mailchimp](mailchimp.png)

Our go-to choice for setting up basic email lists or newsletters for clients. Mailchimp allows them to manage email lists, templates, and more without needing to write code.

If clients need transactional email, or marketing emails + transactional email, we may want to consider using [Sendgrid](../sendgrid) instead.
