# Apprenticeship

Our vision for our apprenticeship program is to produce advanced beginners who are ready to contribute on real team web projects.

We are a team that values education. We offer paid apprenticeships because we love what we do, we want to help create new talent, and we genuinely care about the future of the web.
## Full-stack Apprenticeship

In the first months of the full-stack apprenticeship, apprentices learn our convictions on priority of content, value of design, semantic HTML, and mobile-first CSS. Apprentices are exposed to our Github-centric project management, deployment processes, best practices for clean code and separation of concerns, and unit testing techniques.

By the end of the apprenticeship, apprentices will be interacting as full-fledged developers. With new confidence, they'll have some work under their belt—and that’s when the real fun begins.

## Frontend Designer Apprenticeship

Our frontend design apprentices learn the skills needed to be a web designer in today’s quickly changing responsive web world. Apprentices start by learning to write semantic HTML and CSS and quickly progress to working on projects where they create wireframes and interface designs. We guide them through the iterative design process, point out things to keep in mind, and help them arrive at a compelling visual concept. During that process, apprentices learn to code their concepts like a pro, using Sass to help write, manage, and compile their CSS.

By the end of the apprenticeship, apprentices will have the skills to function as a full-fledged frontend designer. They'll also have a couple of projects behind them and the knowledge needed to tackle what’s next.
