# About the Sparkbox Developer Career Growth Framework

The [Sparkbox Developer Career Growth Framework][Career Growth Framework] is
organized by key areas such as _Communication & Leadership_, _Technical Skill_,
_Impact_, etc. We consider growth along the framework to occur in three
distinct ways: _scope_, _frequency_, and _versatility_.

## Scope
Scope can be described in terms of the influence or audience of capabilities in
any key area. Capabilities shape the individual contributor early in a career
and grow to influence project teams, multiple teams, and the company. Your
ability to have a positive impact beyond your personal success is a common theme
you’ll see as you read about how capabilities grow through the levels.

## Frequency
Frequency can be described using sometimes, often, and usually. A capability
exercised sometimes might be new to an individual, possibly being learned, and
at times, the individual might overlook appropriate opportunities to apply that
capability. A capability exercised often is comfortable to the individual,
exercised well, but often with guidance or reminding. A capability exercised
usually is done well, consistently, and is self-initiated.

## Versatility
Versatility can be described in terms of the range of projects, technologies,
and situations one is able to reliably have an impact on. Experience, skill, and
training shape an individual’s versatility and influence the speed at which an
individual can impact a situation. Versatility is a measure of your ability to
have a positive impact across project types, technology stacks, layers of the
web, business industries, and situations.

Though we are still learning, we expect folks should find themselves at a level
where they are exercising most or many of the capabilities described often or
usually. We also expect folks will have strengths that they exercise above their
level and areas for growth below their level.

As folks are considering the three, distinct growth trajectories, it is helpful
to review the [Career Growth Framework][Career Growth Framework] and complete the statement:

> I am at the developer level ______, because I often or usually exercise the
> following capabilities at the scope described in this level. I have shown an
> ability to positively impact the following projects using the technologies.
